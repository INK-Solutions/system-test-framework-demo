## Getting started

This is a template project for a typical microservices that exposes a rest contract, has relational DB, publishes some events to kafka and reads events from kafka. 

The project has an initial structure on top of which anyone can start building an event-driven service.
The goal of the project is to gather all dependencies, give the initial structure and exemplify how the structure can be used.
Most of the written code is meant to serve as an example and should be replaced with real code. The structure and overall approach is expected to stay. 

## TODO
- Remove credentials 
- Adjusting system test to work with kafka
